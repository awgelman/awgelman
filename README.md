## Hello, all!

I'm Adam Gelman, a researcher and, as of recently, a Master of Science with a degree in Biosystems Engineering from the University of Arizona.

I am currently (as of Jan. 2025) working on my thesis revisions and uploading my statistical analysis code to GitHub for public reference.

If you have questions or need to reach me for any reason, please email me at adamwg@cox.net.
